                    <p>

</ul>

The fees by default do not include the costs of a theory test. A theory test can be booked as an additional extra to the course chosen for a fee of £45.

<p>
If it takes you more than 6 months to pass your theory test, PassVeryFast reserves the right to adjust your course fees. Your booking may be placed on hold until these fees are paid.
<p>
When making an advance booking—usually because the customer is not yet 17 and/or they do not have a valid provisional licence in hand—the customer agrees that we reserve the right to review the price of their course on the date we're able to progress with their booking. This would typically be the date they turn 17, or the date they're able to provide us with valid provisional licence details.
                   
                   
                    <h2 class="section-title">B. Payment</h2>

                    </p>
                    

                    <h2 class="section-title">D. Practical Driving Tests</h2>
                    <p>

<p>
We will send you a potential test date by email/WhatsApp. You must respond to accept/reject the proposed test date within 7 days of the email/WhatsApp message being sent. If we don’t hear from you within 7 days, the date will be reallocated, and your course placed on hold.
