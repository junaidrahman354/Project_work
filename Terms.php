In these Terms and Conditions, any use of the phrase “working days” refers to days other than a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday.


By booking with us, you are agreeing to these Terms and Conditions.

Driving Courses

The Courses available through PassVeryFast take place in England, Scotland, and Wales only

In making this booking, you confirm that you hold, or are eligible for, a valid UK provisional driving licence

The Course Fees (“Fees”) are as listed on the PassVeryFast website, and include:

PassVeryFast’s administration fee which covers connecting you to a driving instructor; booking your theory and/or practical driving test; managing your test bookings; and providing service throughout your course

the tuition fee for the lessons from the driving instructor

the DVSA driving test fee(s)

The fees by default do not include the costs of a theory test. A theory test can be booked as an additional extra to the course chosen for a fee of £45.

As the practical driving test and theory test require you to apply your own skill and knowledge, PassVeryFast does not and cannot guarantee that you will pass your practical driving test or theory test.

PassVeryFast does not guarantee to satisfy your preference regarding your driving instructor’s gender, car make, car model, or car fuel type

If it takes you more than 6 months to pass your theory test, PassVeryFast reserves the right to adjust your course fees. Your booking may be placed on hold until these fees are paid.

When making an advance booking—usually because the customer is not yet 17 and/or they do not have a valid provisional licence in hand—the customer agrees that we reserve the right to review the price of their course on the date we're able to progress with their booking. This would typically be the date they turn 17, or the date they're able to provide us with valid provisional licence details.

Payment

At the point of purchase, you will be required make an initial payment to secure your course. This could range from the deposit (“Deposit”) up to the full value of your course. The non-refundable deposit is typically £100 unless otherwise stated at the time of booking.   

Unless you pay in full when booking your course, PassVeryFast will contact you to take the remaining amount of the fees due. The full payment of the fees becomes due:

Within 7 days of your driving instructor being allocated or before your first lesson start date, if sooner. If payment isn’t made and reminders are ignored, your course will be placed on hold, and both your practical driving test and lessons will be cancelled/postponed.

PassVeryFast will pay your driving instructor on your behalf. In cases of non-payment, withdrawal, or incorrect cancellation, PassVeryFast are entitled to claim fees from you on the driving instructor’s behalf.

If PassVeryFast is required to book more than one theory test for you, a £45 must be made in advance of each additional theory test. This can be done indefinitely.

Payment can be made using our company bank details, you can request our company bank details by contacting us on WhatsApp 07935199032.

From time-to-time promo/discount/coupon codes may be available based on campaigns or other circumstances. However, if we feel that an associated discount has been applied to a transaction which is outside of the intended scope, the booking will be null and void, and the transaction will be refunded.

Lessons

You must hold a valid UK provisional driving licence and present it to your driving instructor at the start of your first lesson. You must bring your licence with you to all your lessons and tests. Failure to do so will result in the lesson and/or test being cancelled without a refund.

It is not possible to change instructor once allocated. Should you relocate or wish to change transmission, we will try to facilitate the required changes to your driving instructor and course for a £30 admin fee. In these cases, you take on the risk posed by the changes and will not be eligible for a refund under our Money-Back Guarantee should we fail to successfully rearrange your course.

Any arrangements for the driving lessons, including the start/finish time and start/finish location, shall be agreed between you and the driving instructor directly

It is your responsibility to be on time for your lessons. As the driving instructor may have other lessons to deliver, the lessons will not be extended to compensate for you arriving late.

If you do not attend a lesson, the driving instructor will be entitled to keep the full tuition fee of the missed lesson and the lesson time will be deducted from your course hours.

The total course time includes any breaks that the driving instructor may feel is necessary for the safety of both you and the driving instructor in accordance with any regulations

Reducing your course hours is not possible once an instructor has been allocated

Please give your instructor at least 4 clear days(excluding weekend) notice before cancelling or rescheduling your lesson, the lesson would be chargeable at a full cost of the booked lesson otherwise.

The driving instructor may refuse to proceed with a driving lesson if you use abusive language or threatening behaviour, or if you fail to act on any reasonable request made by the driving instructor. The driving instructor may also refuse to proceed if they believe you are under the influence of alcohol or drugs during the lesson.

PassVeryFast will assess on a case-by-case basis any missed/cancelled lessons or tests due to the driving instructor being ill, vehicle breakdowns or any other circumstance outside of PassVeryFast’s or the driving instructor’s control.

You must have reasonable availability for lessons on a weekly basis

You have six months after booking the course to start your lessons, unless agreed otherwise between you and PassVeryFast. If an agreement is not made and your driving lessons have not started within this six-month period, your deposit and up to 100% of your fees will be non-refundable.

Practical Driving Tests

PassVeryFast will aim to find a practical driving test that meets your reasonable requirements as soon as possible from the working day after receiving your accurately completed Details Form.

We will send you a potential test date by email/WhatsApp. You must respond to accept/reject the proposed test date within 7 days of the email/WhatsApp message being sent. If we don’t hear from you within 7 days, the date will be reallocated, and your course placed on hold.

The time for the practical driving test is included in the overall time of the course. Depending on your location, up to 4 hours of your course may be reserved for the driving test date.

You may change or cancel your tests, whether theory or practical, by giving PassVeryFast at least 5 working days' notice before the date of each such arranged test.

If 5 working days’ notice is not given to PassVeryFast, you’ll be required to pay the standard DVSA fee of £62.00 for a practical driving test or £23.00 for a theory test, plus an administration fee for the fast-tracking service.

If you ask PassVeryFast to change your theory or test appointment, a £49 administration fee to cover additional work will be payable before we can start to make the requested changes. This administration fee will be waived if you add additional hours to your course

PassVeryFast will not be responsible for tests moved or cancelled by the DVSA. If the DVSA does move or cancel your test, you and PassVeryFast will be notified by the DVSA.

You cannot book under the assumption that PassVeryFast will find a weekend or evening practical driving test. You must be available to take a practical driving test between 07:00 and 15:30, Monday to Friday.

If PassVeryFast secure a weekend or evening practical driving test for you, an additional charge of £14.50 will apply.

The driving instructor may refuse to allow you to take a practical driving test in the driving instructor’s car if they reasonably determine your driving does not meet the necessary standard to take a practical driving test on the grounds that it would be a risk to the health and safety of pedestrians and other motorists, or there is a risk of damage to the driving instructor’s property and livelihood.

Cancellations & Refunds

You have the right to cancel your booking up to 14 days from your date of your payment to PassVeryFast.

You can cancel your booking within the 14 days period from the date you have paid to PassVeryFast, no refund will be given otherwise.

If you’re a repeat customer, it will be assumed that you want PassVeryFast to start work on your booking right away and therefore waive your right to the 14-day cancellation period unless you explicitly state otherwise.

The non-refundable deposit will always be retained unless circumstances fall into our Money-Back Guarantee. Our Money-Back Guarantee states the deposit is only refundable if:

PassVeryFast is unable to secure a suitable practical driving test in line with our course completion timescales within 90 days of receiving your full payment.

If you need to sit your theory test at the time of booking your course, the 90 days will begin the working day after you inform us that you’ve passed the theory test.

PassVeryFast is unable to allocate a driving instructor within 45 days of you confirming your practical test date is suitable. For courses without a practical driving test, the 45 days starts upon receipt of the payment.

Once a suitable driving instructor has been allocated to your course, 100% of fees are non-refundable.

Any refund given will be made back to the original payment method from which the original payment was made. Refunds can take up to 15 working days from the day they are processed to show in the receiving account.

Any unused hours from your lessons package booked via PassVeryFast are non-refundable & non-transferable. Unused lessons can be used for additional tuition (e.g., motorway driving lessons), at the discretion of your driving instructor.

On Hold & Expired Bookings

If your course is on hold for any reason, PassVeryFast will cease all work relating to your course until you instruct PassVeryFast to resume. 

We will consider your course to be on hold if:

You instruct PassVeryFast to place your course on hold

PassVeryFast has attempted to contact you for any reason, and it has been 15 days without response

PassVeryFast has notified you of a suitable Test appointment and you have not responded to either confirm or reject after 7 days.

You have failed to pay your remaining balance when asked and within the required timeframe

If your course is on hold or needs to be rearranged for any reason, PassVeryFast reserve the right to increase course fees in line with course prices at the time of reopening the booking

If your course is on hold for over 90 days, your booking will expire, all fees will be non-refundable, and it won’t be possible to reopen the booking

Behaviour

Your deposit will be non-refundable. Up to 100% of the remainder of the fees may also be non-refundable to cover costs already incurred by PassVeryFast or your driving instructor.
